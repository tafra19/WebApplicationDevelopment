  <h3>Choose My Meal</h3
  <p>User problem: Not being able to pick a meal to cook at home. This website will prompt users to answer a couple of questions to take their preferences/meal restrictions into account, then randomly generate a meal and provide the recipe for it.</p>
    <p>User: People who are indecisive like me, are feeling a little adventerous, but don't want to spend money on eating out.</p>
    <p>Comparison: Users can just directly search up recipes on a search engine, but this website will add a little fun to the process of choosing what to cook.</p>
    <p>Expansion Idea: Users can contribute to the recipe database</p>
